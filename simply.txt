Let's briefly review what we want.

We want: 1. A bidder to commit to a bid x (hiding, binding)

    2. At reveal time, to be able to "see" provably who has won.

How to achieve this?

Approach 1:

    Reveal the committed bids only to the owner.

    Have the owner sort them.

    Have the owner publish his result, who the winner is.

    Have the owner prove that he is honest.

Problem with approach 1:

    How to reveal only to the owner?
        That is, how to send a private message through a public channel?

    - Encrypt to the owner?
        But then, how to prove that this revelation is honest?

Approach 2:

    Reveal the committed bids to everyone,
        but in such a way that only the order is revealed, not the value.

Problem with approach 2:

    Order-Revealing Encryptions require a symmetric key.
        That is, if a bidder encrypts his bid himself,
        he will be able to decrypt other encrypted bids too.

    - Encrypt the ORE to the owner?
        But then, how to prove that the published result corresponds to
        an encrypted ORE?

After some thought, we see that both problems are, in essence, the same!

The problem, abstractly, is this:

    How to prove that a decryption corresponds to an encryption, without
    revealing the decryption key?

Solution, simply:

    Commit to the decryption!

That means:

    For Approach 1:
        Have the decryption be committed to beforehand.

    For Approach 2:
        Encrypt the revelation to the owner, and have the encryption be
        committed beforehand.

Therefore, both approaches are possible!
