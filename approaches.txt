Approach 1

[bid phase]

bidder =>   x : bid
            y : ore_enc(x)
            z : enc_owner(y)
            [ d : commit(z) + c : commit(y) ]  => to smart contract

[reveal phase]

bidder => reveal commitment
            everyone can access all z's
            but only owner can access all y's

[security]

- owner sees all bids
- everyone sees winning bid

-------- steps
creating an auction:    owner generates params file (sk, params, his public key) + decryption file (his private key)
                        owner uploads params file

bidding:                bidder decides on x
                        bidder downloads params file
                        bidder runs program with x + params file
                        bidder generates commitments file + reveal file
                        bidder uploads commitments file

revealing:              bidder uploads reveal file

Approach 2

[bid phase]

bidder =>   x : bid
            y : enc_owner(x)
            p : pedersen_commit(y) => to smart contract

[reveal phase]

bidder => reveal commitment
            everyone can access all y'sees
            only owner can see actual bids

owner  => generates zkp that winning bid is valid => to smart contract

bidder => can verify the proof

[security]

- owner sees all bids
- bidders see nothing
