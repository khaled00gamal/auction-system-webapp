In order for us to authenticate a user, we need to make sure the user owns an address.
We can do that by letting them sign a message using MetaMask and then sending 
this message to our server. Therefore we will need 2 endpoints:

1-An endpoint that generates a message that needs to be signed by the user.
This message will need to be different for each wallet address and authentication request.
The message will be saved in our database for later use.

2-An endpoint that receives a signature and checks what wallet address was used to sign
the message. If the wallet address and message match the one in step 1,
then we will return a JWT to the client (our react website),
and then use it for authentication.


Weâ€™ll be using firebase for authentication and database
